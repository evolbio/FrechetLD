Source code does three things.

1. Takes empirical CDF for a Luria-Delbr端ck process and fits a Frechet distribution by optimizing the Frechet parameters.
2. Takes an empirical CDF for a Luria-Delbr端ck process and fits a Frechet distribution by using the parameters given in the manuscript listed above
3. For each case, plot the empirical CDF vs the Frechet fit.

The comments within the file src/Luria.jl describe how to run the code.

The input data for calculating the empirical Luria-Delbr端ck CDF is at Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7075655. Those data are required to run the code.
